# beyond life and death
## Quinn Zwarich

The premise behind the simulation is that you are reliving some of the events that take place in the last episode of season 2 of Twin Peaks. When I began work on it, I wanted the user to have more control over their outcome but I eventually decided to focus more on sequentially moving through the parts of the episode that I especially cherish. The music I chose to include is a good example of this. I love the section of Sycamore Trees that plays when Cooper enters the lodge so much that I felt it would be best to have it loop over the course of the entire simulation.
Presence is important to both Twin Peaks and my simulation. More specifically, all of the ways in which one thing can act upon
another without taking a form of its own. It is something difficult to articulate but you see it in Twin Peaks, in the way that characters can find themselves affected and not know why. I tried to channel this through drawing the sycamore trees from Glastonbury in accordance with coordinates that make up an image of Laura Palmer. You donâ€™t see Laura in the trees but it is still her image that defines them.
This idea of presence coupled with the aforementioned nostalgia leads to a negotiation of presence in revisiting beloved memories, moments which inevitably have gone in spite of your best attempts to relive them.
